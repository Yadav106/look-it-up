### Built With

### What I learnt
This project was my first major solo project. There were lot of stuffs to learn in this one like fetching data from API, parsing the deeply nested data into meaningful content for the website, implementing dark themes using CSS properties, conditionally rendering data based on whether it's provided by the API or not, implementing error and information components separately, etc. But the most valuable lesson to take from this project was testing and finding bugs.
